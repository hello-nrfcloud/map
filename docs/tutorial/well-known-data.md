While all LwM2M objects can be visualized by the application, for some objects
we provide dedicated UI elements which better represent the data.

Click the _Location_ tab above to see the data shown on a map.

You can request dedicated UI elements for other objects by
[creating an issue the projects' GitHub repository](https://github.com/hello-nrfcloud/map/issues).
