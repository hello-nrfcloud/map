Using the resources from <em>Sea Water Level</em> you can show both the station
code and the level on the map.

This allows you to create a custom map containing only the devices and data you
want to highlight.

[Here is an example.](#world!m:4:65.18092273234197,20.590049136261882!kartverket-vasstandsdata:r:14230/0!kartverket-vasstandsdata:r:14230/1)

You can share a customized map view (including the map view) always using the
current URL.
