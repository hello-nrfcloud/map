# Customize the map

Using the resources from <em>Sea Water Level</em> you can show both the station
code and the level on the map.

This allows you to create a show-case map only for your custom devices.

[Here is an example.](#world!m:4:65.18092273234197,20.590049136261882!kartverket-vasstandsdata:r:14230/0!kartverket-vasstandsdata:r:14230/1)

You can share a customized map view (including the map view) always using the
current URL.
