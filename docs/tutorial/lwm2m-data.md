# Devices send LwM2M objects

All device data is described using LwM2M objects, which have been registered in
[our protocol repository](https://github.com/hello-nrfcloud/proto-map) .

This allows us to display arbitrary device data in a user-friendly way, with
detail explanation of each value.

Click on the `âŒ„` icon of _Environment_ to explore the data this device has sent.
