# Devices send LwM2M objects

All device data is described using LwM2M objects, which have been registered in
[our protocol repository](https://github.com/hello-nrfcloud/proto-map) .

This allows the application to display device data in a user-friendly way, with
detailed explanation of each value and serves as a generic protocol that is
independent of device type and connection.

Click the `âŒ„` icon of _Environment_ to explore some of the data this device has
sent.
